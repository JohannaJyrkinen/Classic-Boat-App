## Classic Boat App "Veneklassikot"

This is my training project for learning Node.js and MongoDB. The app lists some classic boat classes in Finland and provides advice in the 'tips' section for the yearly spring renovation of wooden boats. The app uses the user's location to display current weather data and offers recommendations on whether it is a good time for varnishing or not, based on the weather data.
