## Classic Boat App "Veneklassikot"

This is my training project for learning Node.js and MongoDB. The app lists some classic sailingboat classes in Finland, and provides advice in the 'tips' section for the yearly spring renovation of wooden boats. The app uses the user's location to display current weather and provides recommendations based on the weather data, indicating whether it is a good time for varnishing or not. The boat data and renovation tips featured in the app are sourced from a database, providing a concise collection of information for users.

In this project, I wanted to experiment with using both open REST API and MongoDB Atlas, as well as test the deployment to the cloud using Render.com.
